Stable Diffusion Turbo – CPU Image Generator

This project provides a lightweight text-to-image generator using Stable Diffusion Turbo from Stability AI. It is optimized to run entirely on CPU, making it accessible for users without GPU resources. The application includes a simple Gradio interface where users can enter any text prompt and generate an image in seconds.

Features

Runs fully on CPU (no GPU required)
Uses StabilityAI SD-Turbo, a distilled, ultra-fast Stable Diffusion model
Clean and minimal Gradio web UI

Adjustable text prompt input
Extremely fast inference (only 2 sampling steps)
Easy to run in Google Colab

How to Use

Run all cells. Required libraries will auto-install.
A Gradio UI will launch inside the notebook.

Enter a prompt such as:

“a futuristic robot walking in neon city streets”
“fantasy landscape with castles and dragons”
The generated image will appear on the right.
